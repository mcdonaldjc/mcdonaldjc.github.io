This is my GitHub Pages website. It's merely for note-keeping and experimentation. Maybe you'll find something useful?

You can build your own site like this, even using Windows, without too much fuss. Follow these guides:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Creating a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
- [Installation - Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
